business is changing how businesses value information . information\nhas become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their\nmarket rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and\nmake contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era ,\ninformation itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the\nability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a\ncontinuous basis absolutely crucial .\ncompanies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage\nimplementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs\ndoubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable\nsolution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they\noften look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage\ntheir information storage systems than distributed models .\ntoday , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses\nfile servers to process i / o requests from end users and other\napplication servers . in this model , all requests for data go through\nthe file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file\nserver can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus .\nthis model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a\nserver can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the\nbus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because\nthe server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck .\nthird , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations ,\nbecause only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if\nthat file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and\nother application servers lose access to the stored files .\nthis model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers\nrely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations\nwhich can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a\ncrawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from\nboth a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage\nsystems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often\ndifficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because\nthese servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to\nthe disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage .\nsans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file\nservers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized\nstorage networks claim higher availability , faster performance ,\ncentralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to\nremove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the\nlan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures\nsmoother back - up operations .\nusing high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high -\nperformance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make\nway for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because\nfibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices\ncan be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network .\nyet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still\ndeveloping . vendors are still working out major product interoperability\nissues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to\nmerge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both\ntogether . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into\na mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial\nbenefits at lower costs .\ngiven that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10\ntimes the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated\nmanagement capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to\nbusiness .\nto contact amy larsen decarlo :\n- -

' s plummeting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign tuesday as the energy giant ' s chief executive officer after only about six months in the job . in an interview yesterday , the 47 - year - old mr . skilling elaborated on his decision to leave houston - based enron . on tuesday , mr . skilling insisted he had resigned for \" personal reasons \" unrelated to enron ' s business activities . in the interview , he reiterated that he wasn ' t under any pressure to resign from the company ' s board or chairman kenneth lay , who has resumed the ceo ' s duties at the nation ' s biggest energy trader . however , yesterday mr . skilling said that his \" personal reasons \" were deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business area during his brief tenure as ceo . calling the company ' s stock performance a \" kind of ultimate score card , \" mr . skilling noted that enron ' s share price had fallen by some 50 % this year . mr . skilling said he took that stock - price drop very personally . \" i put a lot of pressure on myself \" for that decline , he said . \" i felt i must not be communicating well enough \" with investors . he felt this particularly given enron ' s strong financial results over the past several quarters , based largely on growing volumes in its trading business , which covers a range of items , including electricity , pulp and paper . if the stock price had remained up \" i don ' t think i would have felt the pressure to leave , \" he said . in january , enron topped $ 84 a share in new york stock exchange composite trading . it closed tuesday , before the announcement of mr . skilling ' s resignation , at $ 42 . 93 a share . as of 4 p . m . yesterday , enron traded at $ 40 . 25 , after falling below $ 37 during the day . mr . skilling , who had been at enron 11 years , said the depressed stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow enron employees , many of whom are shareholders . \" people would say ` what is going on with the stock , jeff ? ' i would have to say i didn ' t know . it has been frustrating , \" said mr . skilling . the self - portrait offered by mr . skilling in the interview is rather different from the widely held image of him as an ambitious , bright and thick - skinned business strategist whose long - held goal had been becoming enron ceo . mr . skilling said that the \" final straw \" in his decision to leave had come on a visit last week to england in connection with the deaths of three enron workers in a power - plant accident there . that trip helped reinforce \" how tenuous life is , \" said mr . skilling , who has three children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged . while mr . skilling said enron is in \" great shape , \" his departure raised anxiety in the investment community . merrill lynch , for instance , lowered its rating on enron to neutral from buy based on \" uncertainty \" created by the resignation . yesterday , an enron spokesman confirmed that mr . lay plans to name two executives to the existing \" office of the chairman \" within the next few days or weeks . the spokesman said mr . lay hadn ' t yet revealed whom the two would be . the office of the chairman had consisted of mr . lay and mr . skilling .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\n\nIs this email a phishing email or not?"}]}, {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Non-Phishing"}]}]}
